       " 'Summary': \"In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained immense attention\\ndue to their notable emergent capabilities, surpassing those seen in earlier\\nlanguage models. A particularly intriguing application of LLMs is their role as\\nevaluators for texts produced by various generative models.\\n  In this study, we delve into the potential of LLMs as reliable assessors of\\nfactual consistency in summaries generated by text-generation models.\\nInitially, we introduce an innovative approach for factuality assessment using\\nLLMs. This entails employing a singular LLM for the entirety of the\\nquestion-answering-based factuality scoring process. Following this, we examine\\nthe efficacy of various LLMs in direct factuality scoring, benchmarking them\\nagainst traditional measures and human annotations.\\n  Contrary to initial expectations, our results indicate a lack of significant\\ncorrelations between factuality metrics and human evaluations, specifically for\\nGPT-4 and PaLM-2. Notable correlations were only observed with GPT-3.5 across\\ntwo factuality subcategories. These consistent findings across various factual\\nerror categories suggest a fundamental limitation in the current LLMs'\\ncapability to accurately gauge factuality.\\n  This version presents the information more concisely while maintaining the\\nmain points and findings of the original text.\",\n",

Consequently,\\nestablishing the factual accuracy of a summary con-\\ntinues to be the key for the evaluation of summa-\\nrization models (Fabbri et al., 2021b, 2022). To\\nresolve this issue, recent studies have utilized tech-\\nniques like natural language inference, question-\\nanswering, or syntactic dependency as factuality\\nevaluation metrics (Honovich et al., 2022). How-\\never, as highlighted by Pagnoni et al. (2021), none\\nof these automatic factuality metrics demonstrate a\\nconsiderable correlation (i.e., fails to achieve a cor-\\nrelation score above 0.3) with human evaluations,\\npointing to the limited efficacy of these measures.\\nThe emergence and subsequent advancements\\nof LLMs, such as ChatGPT1, have transformed the\\nlandscape of natural language processing (NLP).\\nChatGPT-like LLMs (Google, 2023; Touvron et al.,\\n2023b; OpenAI, 2023) have displayed impressive',\n",

Consequently, we also\\nstudy whether LLMs can be directly used to predict\\nthe faithfulness score of the generated summary for\\na given article.\\nMeanwhile, one major limitation in factuality\\nevaluation is the lack of common benchmarks.\\nThis makes the comparison of various factuality\\nmetrics quite difficult. To address this issue, var-\\nious benchmarks have been introduced recently\\nfor factual consistency evaluation, such as Sum-\\nmEval (Fabbri et al., 2021a) and FRANK (Pagnoni\\net al., 2021). These benchmarks are designed to\\nevaluate various metrics on their ability to cap-\\nture factual errors in abstractive summarization.\\nAmong the available benchmarks, the FRANK\\nbenchmark is the largest one consisting of human-\\nannotated factuality scores of summaries from di-\\nverse datasets.

Below, we first\\npresent these methods.\\n(i) QA-based Factuality Metric via LLMs:\\nThe reason we chose to incorporate LLMs into\\nthe QA-based factuality metric is that it is more re-\\nliable than most other existing automatic factuality\\nmetrics for assessing the factual consistency of a\\nmodel (Huang et al., 2021). The typical process of\\nusing QA-based systems as factuality evaluators is\\ncomprised of 3 tasks:\\n(i) Answer Selection: The commencement of\\nthis procedure involves extracting key points, re-\\nferred to as “answers” from the provided summary.\\n(ii) Question Generation: After identifying the\\nanswers, the next step is to formulate questions\\nbased on these answers, using the summary as the\\ncontext.',\n",
       "  'context.\\n(iii) Question Answering: The final step is re-\\nsponding to the generated questions using the input\\ndocument as a reference.\\nIn this paper, contrary to the traditional approach\\nof utilizing separate models to perform each task\\nthat makes the QA-based factuality evaluation pro-\\ncess very complicated, we propose one single LLM\\nto be used as the QA-based factuality metric evalu-\\nator to perform all steps. For prompt construction,\\nwe first evaluate various prompts in some samples\\nand then select the one for our experiment that per-\\nforms the best. We show our selected prompt for\\nthis task that we use in our experiments in Table 1.\\nIn our prompt, we leverage the in-context learn-\\ning principle and provide an associated example\\nwith our prompt to the LLMs to perform the first\\ntwo tasks: initial answer selection and question\\ngeneration. Since both the initial answer and the\\nquestions are required to be generated from the\\ngiven summary (making both the question and the',\n",
       "  'answer to have some dependencies between them),\\nwe unify these two steps together by asking the\\nLLM to generate both the answer and the ques-\\ntion simultaneously from the given summary. This\\nmakes the first two steps of the QA-based pipeline\\nto be more efficient. Afterward, the generated ques-\\ntion and the article are given as input to the LLM to\\ngenerate the final answer. The evaluation process of\\nthe QA-based factuality metric depends on finding\\nthe similarity between the initially selected answer\\nand the final answer. The higher the similarity, the\\nmore faithful the summary is being considered.\\n(ii) Direct Faithfulness Scoring via LLMs:\\nSimilar to how we constructed prompts for the QA-\\nbased factuality metric evaluation, we first eval-\\nuate various prompts in a set of samples and se-\\nlect the one for full experiments that performs the\\nbest.

(2023),\\nhave indicated the potential of automatic metrics in\\nassessing factuality, not accounting for confound-\\ning variables associated with system and dataset\\nproperties in some contexts might influence the\\nperceived correlations Pagnoni et al. (2021). In\\ncontrast, our experiment addresses this concern\\nby incorporating partial correlation coefficients,\\nleveraging the FRANK benchmark (Pagnoni et al.,\\n2021). The FRANK benchmark not only contains\\ndata from diverse datasets but also features a com-\\nprehensive typology of factual errors, allowing for\\na more nuanced understanding of the inaccuracies\\nin generated summaries. As given in the FRANK\\nbenchmark, we measure partial correlation in terms\\nof the following:\\n1. Factuality Errors: This is the overall factual-\\nity error.\\n2. Semantic Frame Errors: Errors that occur\\ndue to the incorrect understanding of the re-\\nlationships and roles in a situation or event.',\n",
       "  'Example: Predicate Errors, Entity Errors and\\nCircumstance Errors.\\n• Predicate Errors (PredE): Incorrect or\\nmisrepresented predicates in summaries.\\n• Entity Errors (EntE): Wrong entities\\nmentioned.\\n• Circumstance Errors (CircE): Inaccu-\\nrate details regarding the circumstances\\nof an event.\\n3. Discourse Errors: It refers to incorrect links\\nbetween different parts of a summarized text.\\nExample: Coreference Errors and Discourse\\nLink Errors.\\n• Coreference Errors (CorefE): Refers\\nto incorrect references (e.g., pronoun).\\n• Discourse Link Errors (LinkE): Errors\\nin connecting statements logically within\\na discourse.\\n4.

However, the Exact\\nMatch could be excessively stringent. Thus, we\\nopt for the word F1 which offers a more balanced\\nevaluation for answer overlap.\\n(i) LLM as QA-based Factuality Metrics:\\nWe\\nshow our results for the QA-based factuality eval-\\nuation in Table 2. For overall factuality (referred\\nto as “Factuality Errors\"), only PaLM-2 displays\\na statistically significant p-value of 0.0121 for the\\nSpearman partial correlation. This indicates that\\nthere is no linear correlation between human judg-\\nment and the LLM-QA score, as the correlation\\ncoefficient is −0.0632. For the majority of factu-\\nality error subcategories, PaLM-2, GPT-3.5 and\\nGPT-4 do not have statistically significant p-values\\nfor the Pearson correlation coefficient. However,\\nthe correlation values for all are very close to zero,',\n",
       "  'which indicates no linear correlation between hu-\\nman judgment and the LLM-QA score even for the\\nsubcategories. In terms of the Spearman correlation\\ncoefficient that is capable of detecting non-linear\\nrelationships, PaLM-2 exhibits a statistically sig-\\nnificant but very weak correlation (greater than 0.1\\nbut less than 0.3) with human judgment in Dis-\\ncourse Errors, CircE, GramE, and LinkE, where\\nthe absolute value exceeds 0.1.\\n(ii) LLM as Direct Faithfulness Scorer:\\nTa-\\nble 3 shows the correlation coefficients calculated\\nbetween the factuality scores assigned by LLMs\\nand the scores corresponding to different types of\\nhuman-annotated errors. In terms of error subcat-\\negories, we see PaLM-2 doesn’t show any corre-\\nlation with high p-values and close to zero coeffi-\\ncients. Both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 also do not have\\nany significant Pearson correlation scores.

In addition\\nto directly using LLMs to evaluate the factuality\\nof a summary, we also introduce a novel approach\\nthat utilizes one single LLM to perform various\\nsteps of the QA-based factuality scoring pipeline.\\nContrary to expectations, our findings revealed that\\nnone of the approaches showed a significant corre-\\nlation (with a coefficient greater than 3) to human\\nevaluations of factuality for most LLMs, with the\\nonly exception happening while directly generat-\\ning the LLM faithfulness scores by GPT-3.5 in',\n",

In some contexts, not accounting for\\nconfounding variables associated with system and\\nthe dataset properties might influence the perceived\\ncorrelations. To provide a more nuanced perspec-\\ntive, we recommend utilizing partial correlation co-\\nefficients to control for these variables.

The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2024.\n",
      "Non-GAAP Measures\n",
      "To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude acquisition termination costs, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, IP-related costs, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n",

The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2024.\n",
      "Non-GAAP Measures\n",
      "To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude acquisition termination costs, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, IP-related costs, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n",
